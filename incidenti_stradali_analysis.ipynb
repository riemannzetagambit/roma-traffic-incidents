    "So I thought of the current situation I find myself in, living abroad in the eternal city, Rome. If someone asks me what I like most of Rome, I must give pause and think of its infinite beautiful facades. But if someone asks me what I like least, I can answer quite easily: traffic. Rather than complaining, as one is wont to do in (southern(ish)) Italy, I decided that perhaps I could use my nascent learned data science skills to see if I can't learn something useful about Rome's traffic catastrophe and find patterns that only statistical methods on large data sets can find.\n",

Unfortunately for discriminating against the two data sets it seems incidences involving death or injury do not follow any particularly distinct pattern from those that do not.\n",
